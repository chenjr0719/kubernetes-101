# Requirements

## Docker

Before you start this practice, please make sure you have `Docker` on your laptop/workstation.
If you are using `Docker Desktop`, please increase the RAM of your VM to at least **8GB**.
If you are using `Docker` on any Linux distro, please make sure you can use the docker command without sudo. Please check here to get more information:

<https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user>

## Kubectl

To access the kubernetes cluster, you will need to use the tool called `kubectl`.
About how to install the `kubectl`, please check the official doc here:

<https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl>

## Helm

To deploy third-party applications/services to K8s, we will use `Helm` to help us.
Please following the doc to setup the helm CLI first.
